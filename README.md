## What is n8n?

n8n is an easy-to-use tool that allows you to automate actions between different web apps, such as LearningSuite. Creating so-called "workflows" between apps automates many of the manual tasks. This can save you or your employees a tremendous amount of time.

## 🔐 Set up authentication

### Generate API key

2. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**

3. Click **"Generate API key"**

4. Copy the generated API key

### Configure credentials in n8n

1. Open n8n and Go to **Credentials**

2. Click **"New Credential"**

3. Search for **"LearningSuite API"**

4. Fill in the following fields:

- **API Key**: Your generated API key

- **Base URL**: `https://api.learningsuite.io/api/v1` (default)

5. Test the connection and save

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Member Operation

```

1. Add a "LearningSuite" node

2. Select Resource: "Member"

3. Select Operation: "Get by Email"

4. Enter the email address

5. Execute the workflow

```

### Custom Field File Uploads

The Custom Fields resource supports file, image, video, and audio custom fields.

- Use **Set Field Value**, **Set Multiple Field Values**, or **Update Profile Field** when the file is available as n8n binary data.
- Use **Upload File From URL** when LearningSuite should download a public file URL and append the returned file value to the selected custom field.
- File fields support **File Value Mode**:
  - **Add**: append new file values and fail if the custom field limit would be exceeded
  - **Replace**: replace existing file values with the uploaded file values
  - **Replace if Limit Reached**: append while possible, otherwise replace existing file values
- The node respects the LearningSuite file limits defined on the custom field, such as `maxFiles`, `maxImages`, `maxVideos`, and `maxAudios`.
- For custom field cards with multiple profiles, use Profile ID, Profile Index, or Profile Name to target a specific profile. If the card does not allow multiple profiles, profile parameters are ignored and the default profile is used.
